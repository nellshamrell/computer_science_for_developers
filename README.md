computer_science_for_developers
===============================

Filling in the gaps for developers without a computer science background by showing how computer science principles apply to real world coding.

This is meant to answer the question "Why does it matter?"  Why do developers need to know algorithms and data structures when Ruby already has these built in?  When will Big-O notation ever be useful in real life?

Come along for a journey through the basics of computer science (this curriculum assumes a familiarity with basic web development) and learn why it matters to you in your every day coding.
